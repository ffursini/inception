# Description:
# This is the Nginx configuration file for the WordPress site.
# It sets up an HTTPS server listening on port 443, using the self-signed
# SSL certificate generated in the Dockerfile. The server is configured to
# work with PHP-FPM for processing PHP files, which are passed to the
# WordPress container. It also includes basic security settings and
# routing rules for WordPress.
